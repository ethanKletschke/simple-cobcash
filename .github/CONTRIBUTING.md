# Contributing to CobCash

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CobCash!

This project is intentionally maintained as a solo portfolio project. As such,
I am not accepting external code contributions, pull requests, or direct
modifications at this time.

That said, feedback is still very welcome. If you encounter a bug, unexpected 
behaviour, or have a suggestion for improvement, please open a 
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/ethanKletschke/CobCash/issues). This helps me 
track problems and improve the project while keeping its development direction 
consistent.

Thank you for your understanding and for taking the time to check out CobCash!
