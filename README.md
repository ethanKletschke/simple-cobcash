## Disclaimer

This program does no real processing as of yet. It merely displays the input
"Screen" (terminal UI) for user input, and a debug screen that shows variable
values.

## Planned Features

- Using the `SCREEN` section for different sections of the program, i.e., input, 
  processing, and output.
- File handling to "print out a receipt".
